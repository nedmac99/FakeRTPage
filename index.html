    <p>Rooster Teeth is a pioneering online entertainment company founded in 2003, known for its diverse content in gaming, animation, comedy, and web series. Initially rising to fame with "Red vs. Blue," a popular machinima series created from the game "Halo," the company expanded its offerings to include hits like "RWBY," "Achievement Hunter," and "Camp Camp."
